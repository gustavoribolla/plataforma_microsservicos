## What is an Orchestrator?
An orchestrator is a system that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and operation of containerized applications. Containers package an application with its dependencies, making it portable across environments. Orchestrators handle critical tasks such as:

- **Scheduling**: Placing containers on appropriate servers.
- **Scaling**: Adding or removing containers based on demand.
- **Networking**: Managing communication between containers.
- **Self-healing**: Restarting failed containers or redistributing workloads.
- **Service discovery**: Enabling containers to find and communicate with each other.

By abstracting infrastructure complexities, orchestrators ensure applications run reliably and efficiently, especially in large-scale, distributed systems. They are essential for enterprises managing hundreds or thousands of containers across multiple hosts, supporting cloud-native development and microservices architectures [Container Orchestration - Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-container-orchestration){:target="_blank"}.

Orchestrators like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos provide these capabilities, each with unique features and complexities. Kubernetes is the most widely adopted orchestrator, known for its robust ecosystem and community support.

## Difference Between Docker Compose and Kubernetes
Docker Compose and Kubernetes (K8s) both manage containerized applications but serve different purposes, with distinct scopes, complexities, and use cases:

### Docker Compose
- **Purpose**: Designed for single-host environments, ideal for development, testing, or small-scale production.
- **Configuration**: Uses a YAML file to define multi-container applications, specifying services, networks, and volumes.
- **Features**: Simplifies container networking and dependency management on one machine. Supports basic restart policies but lacks advanced features like auto-scaling or cluster management.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple to set up with a lower learning curve, making it accessible for developers.
- **Use Case**: Best for local development (e.g., running a web app with a database) or simple production setups where scalability isn’t a priority.

### Kubernetes
- **Purpose**: Built for orchestrating containers across a cluster of multiple nodes, suited for production-grade, distributed systems.
- **Configuration**: Uses declarative YAML/JSON files to define desired states, with controllers ensuring the system matches the configuration.
- **Features**: Offers auto-scaling, load balancing, rolling updates, self-healing, service discovery, and storage orchestration.
- **Complexity**: More complex, requiring knowledge of concepts like pods, services, and deployments.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for cloud-native applications needing high availability, scalability, and resilience across multiple servers.

### Key Differences
| Aspect            | Docker Compose                     | Kubernetes                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Scope**         | Single-host                       | Multi-host, cluster-based         |
| **Scalability**   | No auto-scaling                   | Dynamic auto-scaling              |
| **Complexity**    | Simple, low learning curve        | Complex, steeper learning curve   |
| **Use Case**      | Local dev, testing, small prod    | Large-scale, production systems   |

Tools like Kompose can help migrate Docker Compose files to Kubernetes, easing the transition for growing applications [Docker Compose vs Kubernetes - Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/blog/docker-compose-vs-kubernetes).

## Alternatives to Kubernetes

### Notes on Alternatives
- **Nomad** and **Docker Swarm** prioritize simplicity, making them suitable for teams with limited resources or simpler workloads [Kubernetes Alternatives - Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/academy/kubernetes-alternatives){:target="_blank"}.
- **OpenShift** enhances Kubernetes with enterprise features but increases complexity, best for organizations needing robust tooling.
- **Cloud-native options** like Amazon ECS, Google Cloud Run, and AWS Fargate reduce management overhead but tie users to specific cloud providers, limiting portability.
- **Local tools** like Minikube and Docker Compose are not production-ready but excel in development and learning environments.
- **Managed Kubernetes services** (GKE, EKS) simplify Kubernetes operations but still require Kubernetes expertise, making them less of a true alternative for those avoiding K8s complexity.

Choosing the right tool depends on factors like workload scale, team expertise, infrastructure constraints, and whether portability across clouds is needed. For small projects, Docker Compose or Nomad may suffice, while large, distributed systems often benefit from Kubernetes or cloud-native solutions like ECS.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust framework for running distributed systems resiliently, allowing you to manage clusters of hosts running Linux containers. A `cluster` is a set of machines (physical or virtual) that run Kubernetes and can be managed as a single entity. To manage these clusters, Kubernetes uses a set of APIs and a control plane to manage the state of the cluster.

        Secret:::orange
    end

    ConfigMap --> Deployment

    classDef red fill:#f55
    classDef orange fill:#ffa500
```

- **Deployment**: This is like the manager for your application, deciding how many copies (replicas) should run and updating them when needed.

- **ReplicaSet**: It ensures the right number of Pods (the actual running containers) are always available, creating or deleting them as necessary.

- **Pod**: The smallest unit, where your application actually runs, often containing one or more containers.

- **Container**: The actual application running inside the Pod, isolated from others.

- **Service**: This is like a load balancer, directing traffic to the right Pods based on rules you set. A Service allows you to expose your application to the outside world or to other applications within the cluster. The exposed service can be of different types:

    | Types of Services | Description |
    |------------------|-------------|
    | **ClusterIP** | The default type, which exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. This means that the service is only reachable from within the cluster. |
    | **NodePort** | Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port. This allows you to access the service from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. |
    | **LoadBalancer** | Creates an external load balancer in supported cloud providers, routing traffic to your service. |

- **ConfigMap**: A way to pass configuration data to your application without hardcoding it into the container.

- **Secret**: Similar to ConfigMap, but used for sensitive information like passwords or API keys, ensuring they are stored securely.

Example of a simple Kubernete's YAML files:

=== "secrets.yaml"

    ``` { .yaml .copy .select linenums="1" }
    --8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insper/platform/refs/heads/main/docs/checkpoints/5/k8s/secrets.yaml"
    ```

    ```{ .bash .copy .select }
    kubectl apply -f ./k8s/secrets.yaml
    kubectl get secrets
    ```

=== "configmap.yaml"

    ``` { .yaml .copy .select linenums="1" }
    --8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insper/platform/refs/heads/main/docs/checkpoints/5/k8s/configmap.yaml"
    ```

    ```{ .bash .copy .select }
    kubectl apply -f ./k8s/configmap.yaml
    kubectl get configmap
    ```

=== "deployment.yaml"

    ``` { .yaml .copy .select linenums="1" }
    --8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insper/platform/refs/heads/main/docs/checkpoints/5/k8s/deployment.yaml"
    ```

    ```{ .bash .copy .select }
    kubectl apply -f ./k8s/deployment.yaml
    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get pods
    ```

=== "service.yaml"

    ``` { .yaml .copy .select linenums="1" }
    --8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insper/platform/refs/heads/main/docs/checkpoints/5/k8s/service.yaml"
    ```

    ```{ .bash .copy .select }
    kubectl apply -f ./k8s/service.yaml
    kubectl get services
    ```

!!! tip "Horizontal Pod Autoscaler"

    The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment or replica set based on observed CPU utilization or other select metrics. It adjusts the number of replicas dynamically to ensure that the application can handle varying loads without manual intervention.
    To set up HPA, you need to define the target CPU utilization and the minimum and maximum number of replicas. The HPA controller continuously monitors the metrics and adjusts the number of replicas accordingly.

    Check the documentation for more details on how to set up HPA: [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) and [HorizontalPodAutoscaler Walkthrough](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/){:target="_blank"}.
